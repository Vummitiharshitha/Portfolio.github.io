    <h1>Conclusion and Future Scope</h1>
    <p>In this project we have successfully developed an application, that which can detect and recognize the faces. Here we developed the two types of methods like image and video based by using CNN algorithm. Once after trained the dataset results were tested by uploading image and also video streaming with face inputs.
In future, we should consider training the model on large amount of data to have better accuracy and predictability. This process can help the machines to recognize the facial expressions.
